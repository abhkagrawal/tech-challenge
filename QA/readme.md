## **📝 Tech Assessment - To-Do List App**

### **📌 Overview**
Welcome to the **QA Challenge**! Your objective is to evaluate a simple **To-Do application (AUT)** by performing various **QA tasks** using your preferred test automation tool (**Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium**).

This challenge will assess your ability to create **test plans, automated tests, and basic test reports** while maintaining high-quality, structured, and reusable code.

## **💂️ Project Structure**
```
📆 Todo List App
 ├📄 bars-icon.svg    # UI Icon
 ├📄 index.html       # Main HTML file
 ├📄 script.js        # JavaScript logic
 ├📄 style.css        # Stylesheet
```

## **⚡ Challenge Tasks**
### **1️⃣ Test Planning (30-45 mins)**
Create a concise **test plan** that covers the following test scenarios:
- ✅ Adding a new to-do item
- ✏️ Editing an existing to-do item
- ✅ Marking a to-do item as completed
- ❌ Deleting a to-do item

📌 **Deliverable:**  
Provide the test plan in **Markdown (`test-plan.md`) or plain text (`test-plan.txt`)** format.

---

### **2️⃣ Test Automation (2.5 - 3 hours)**
- Implement automated tests for **at least three** of the above scenarios.
- Use **Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium**.
- Ensure **tests are well-structured and reusable**.

📌 **Deliverable:**  
- Submit all test scripts under a new `/tests` directory in the repository.
- Ensure proper assertions and validations are included.

---

### **3️⃣ Basic Test Reporting (30-45 mins)**
Implement a simple **test reporting mechanism** that provides:
- 🟢 **Number of tests executed**
- 🟡 **Number of tests passed/failed**
- 🔴 **Brief summary of failures (if any)**

📌 **Deliverable:**  
- Include a **reporting mechanism** in your automation framework (console logs or structured output).
- Provide a sample test run output.

---

## **💪 Submission Requirements**
- **GitHub repository** containing:
  - 📄 `test-plan.md` or `test-plan.txt` (Test Plan)
  - 🥞 `/tests/` directory (Test Automation Code)
  - ⚒️ `README.md` with setup and execution instructions

---

## **📊 Evaluation Criteria**
✔️ **Code quality and structure**  
✔️ **Clear, maintainable, and reusable test scripts**  
✔️ **Proper assertions and validations in UI/API tests**  
🌟 **Bonus:** CI/CD integration for automated test execution
