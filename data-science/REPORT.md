# Predictive Modeling of Monitoring Alert Tag

## Problem Definition & Business Context
The core objective was to predict a binary “monitoring alert” flag—indicating normal versus alert conditions—for a sucker-rod pump, using sensor streams that monitor mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal variables. Early and reliable alerts enable field technicians to intervene before costly failures occur, improving uptime and reducing maintenance expenses.

## 1. Data Preparation & Quality Control


**Key steps and rationale**  
- **Timestamp alignment:** Converted the time column to a true `DatetimeIndex` established a consistent temporal framework for resampling, joining disparate sensors.  
- **Gap-filling strategy:** Interpolating small, transient dropouts maintained continuity for temporal features while keeping longer gaps as NaNs to be filtered out later.

## 2. Feature Engineering

**Why it mattered**  
A purely “instantaneous” snapshot of sensor readings often fails to capture the dynamic nature of pump behavior, where trends  and  patterns drive malfunction.

**Key steps and rationale**
- **Feature Selection:** Based on the data analysis which I performed, it was noted that, Surface Temperature was the most important feature to identify the Monitor Alert in addition to Operational Status.
- **Rolling statistics:** Computing windowed averages and standard deviations smoothed high-frequency noise and quantified trend direction and volatility  
- **Column pruning:** Dropping features that were entirely NaN (from overly long windows) ensured we trained on robust, data-rich inputs.

## 3. Model Selection

**Why tree-based Gradient Boosting?**  
- **Mixed inputs:** Our features combined continuous, derived, and one-hot encoded categorical variables. Gradient-boosted trees handle heterogeneous data types naturally without manual scaling or transformation.  
- **Nonlinear interactions:** Mechanical faults often emerge from nonlinear combinations—Trees can learn such conditional logic.  
- **Interpretability & speed:** Feature-importance scores highlighted which sensors and derived trends were most predictive, guiding domain validation. Training was fast enough to iterate on hyperparameters without prolonged compute time.

## 4. Validation Strategy

**Why time-aware splitting and PR-AUC for model scoring?**  
- **Temporal integrity:** Using a chronological train/test split prevented “future leakage” and more closely simulated real deployment, where today’s model predicts tomorrow’s data.  
- **Precision–recall focus:** With alerts being rare events, overall accuracy is misleading. Optimizing for PR-AUC—and choosing thresholds based on recall/precision trade-offs—ensured we prioritized catching true alerts while controlling false alarms.

## 5. Hyperparameter Tuning

**Why randomized search with time-series CV?**  
- **Efficiency:** Sampling combinations across learning rates, tree depths, subsampling ratios, and feature fractions yielded strong candidates without exhaustively exploring every grid point.  
- **Robustness:** Each hyperparameter set was scored via multiple chronological folds, ensuring selected configurations generalized across different historical regimes.

## 6. Deployment & Monitoring

**Why serialization**  
- **Reproducibility:** Saving the  model pipeline guaranteed that new data would be transformed identically to training data, eliminating version mismatch.

## Conclusion & Improvements

- **Feature Engineering:** We can introduce more features like Gearbox Temperature, Gearbox Vibration, Motor Power to develop a robust predictive model  
- **Model alternatives:** We can use a sequence model (LSTM), which might capture long-range dependencies—such as gradual gearbox wear—but requires more data and careful regularization.  
- **Business integration:** Beyond model metrics, the ultimate judgment for any predictive model is whether alerts translate into timely maintenance actions and reduced downtime.
