Present these questions back to your contact at Ambyint.

We will answer your questions and then proceed with making your suggestions / recommendations on what we could do to improve this page.  Explain what you’ve identified, what can be improved, and what you would do differently.

There is no expectation of you to create an HTML page or anything else.  The expectation is that there is an associated mock up with your new design.
